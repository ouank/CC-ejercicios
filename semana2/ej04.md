## Running Normal Assert Testing
Run on Python Class for Project (draft)

trying to create a request, makes sure that the plant name is of type *string*.
![Request Class](imgs/normal_assert.png)
 
Runs once successfully and once failed with the plantname as an sys.argv

![Check Assertion](imgs/assert_fail.png)

In the failing example I changed the code to int(sys.argv[1]) as sys.argv always is a string.
It is an exception here, as in the real case the input argument won't be an sys.argv

## Now using high level test module unittest

Commented out the assertion, as it would otherwise trigger it first:

![Request Class](imgs/code_class.png)

![code unittest successfull](imgs/code_unittest_succ.png)

![terminal successfull](imgs/successful_unittest.png)

And failing mode when giving an int intentionally:

![code unittest fail](imgs/code_unittest_fail.png)

![terminal fail](imgs/failed_unittest.png)
